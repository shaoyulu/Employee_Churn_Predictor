To mitigate the impact of internal employee turnover on company operations, developed a model to predict the
employees who are likely to leave and provide a retention plan.

Conducted EDA to identify employee churn rate. Segmented employees based on demographic and work-related
data, and analyzed churn reasons for each employee group. Built the binary classification models to predict
churned employees. 

The final model is Random Forest, achieving a recall score of 0.93 and F1 score of 0.94.
Deployed the model on AWS with Streamlit for real-time monitoring, aiding in employee retention strategies.
